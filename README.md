## Editing the docs

All of the documentation source lives in `./docs`.

## Building the docusaurus static site

If you want to view live changes, ensure you have the mdoc watcher running, then also start the docusaurus live reload with `docker-compose up`. Changes will be visible at http://localhost:3000.
